# URL Shortener

Simple app with just one page which consists in a text field
where the URL to be shortened should be inserted and a list with
the most recent URLs that has been shortened.

Selecting an item in the list provides the options to copy to
clipboard the original URL or the shortened one. 

## Tests command

The only command that need to be executed is the generator
of mocks files:

 ``` flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs ```
